# Advection-Diffusion-Reaction: Object-Oriented Programming of Simulations (adroops)
Use of FEniCS has made Finite Element Methods more accessible than ever! However, if one wants to quickly simulate the dynamics of phenomena, such as advection-diffusion-reaction problems, and not focus on debugging, then using adroops is a perfect fit.

I wrote adroops for my PhD dissertation work in the Filter Stabilization of Advection-Dominated Advection-Diffusion-Reaction Problems.
